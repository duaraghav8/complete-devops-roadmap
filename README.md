# Complete DevOps Roadmap

Welcome to the Complete DevOps Roadmap!
This repository contains all the assets accompanying my [Video on How to become a DevOps Engineer](https://youtu.be/bm-gIULU59I).

Going forward, we will regularly be updating the data here as technology evolves with time.

In the [assets](./assets) directory, you can find the full Roadmap graphic I used in the video.

Read on for the description and links for each step of the Roadmap!

This plan will help you become a successful DevOps engineer in 1-2 years, so have patience and keep learning!
